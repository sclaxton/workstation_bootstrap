workstation_bootstrap
=====================

This repo contains files necessary to run a bootstrap script to configure a workstation for development. 


Directions
----------

Just run the bootstrap.sh script to bootstrap a work station. 

If running on OSX the terminal.app color scheme must be manually changed to Solarized dark by importing the appropriate .terminal file in [osx-terminal.app-color-solarized](https://github.com/sclaxton/workstation_bootstrap/tree/master/osx-terminal.app-color-solarized). 


Contents
--------

The bootstrap configures bash and vim. Bash is configured to a custom configuration while vim is configured to the [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) platform.
Both configurations use the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark colorscheme. 

The script runs on both OSX and linux operating systems and is compatible with terminal.app and Terminator. 

Maintainance
------------

Will be maintaining this repo for personal use.
